The data policy of MACC products is an open and free access to data, in compliance with the GEOSS (Global Earth Observation System of Systems) Data Sharing Principles. In addition, the data policy of Eumetsat shall govern the use of Meteosat data to produce the MACC-RAD products. A licence agreement comprising the licence terms will be presented to users at their first registration to the information system.

The principles governing the conditions of use are that the customer assumes all the responsibilities for the use of the provided data, especially concerning:

* the fitness-for-purpose of the data to the needs of the customer,
* the use of the data,
* the qualification and expertise of the staff of the customer regarding such data.

The MACC-RAD product is supplied *as is*. The author and provider disclaim all warranties, expressed or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties or merchantability and of fitness for any purpose. The author and provider shall in no event be liable for indirect damages such as loss of profits, loss of markets, loss of clientele, commercial injury or disturbances, brand-image impairment or unfair-competition suits, or other consequential, incidental or special damages in connection with the MACC-RAD products.

The customer acquires a license for the use of the MACC-RAD product. It does not bear any rights upon the products themselves.

For the time-being, the data policy for both ARCH and MSG products is on a commercial basis. The French company Transvalor, a subsidiary of Armines, is taking care of the commercialisation of the database HelioClim-3 through the SoDa Service.
